# Management System for Interns


#### October 20, 2013
This was made(to be created) to manage the current ojt students of the university of the east, manila, or for starter(lol) just for the college of computer studies and system. This has been a long time dream project of Sir Edmond Torres, but was discontinued due to my(Joey Hipolito) lack of time and focus. But... it was stored so that we can keep track of its development(variations?ROFL) over time and to have a general baseline when the development continues.
